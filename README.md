# Hi there, I'm Gene 👋

I'm a student at 42 Bangkok, specializing in automation. I enjoy creating innovative tools and applications that make processes more efficient and user-friendly. Oh, and I'm also Emily's dad, so I'm pretty good at multitasking!

## About Me

I'm currently diving deep into the world of coding at 42 Bangkok, where I'm honing my skills in software development. My passion lies in building robust and scalable solutions to automate and streamline tasks. When I'm not coding, you can find me spending quality time with my daughter Emily, who thinks my keyboard is the coolest toy ever.
